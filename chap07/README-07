exer01: execute exer01.sh with a single argument to check the validity of the
    argument as a shell variable.  For example:

        ./exer01.sh myvar123           # yes
	./exer01.sh _myvar_            # yes
	./exer01.sh 1var               # no
	./exer01.sh ""                 # no
	./exer01.sh "  somespace1"     # no
	./exer01.sh "somespace2  "     # no
	./exer01.sh "myvar1 myvar2"    # no


exer02: execute exer02_arith.sh, exer02_case.sh, and exer02_expr.sh and visually
    compare the output to that from date to make sure that they are each
    properly converting the times.

    Note that using the current time isn't sufficient to test all of the edge
    cases.  It's probably advisable to find a way to artificially manipulate the
    program to test a range of times, e.g. 12:30am, 5:30am, 10:30am, 12:30pm,
    5:30pm, 10:30pm.


exer03: the file text is provided to facilitate testing with exer03.sh; however,
    as per the directions exer03.sh overwrites the original file so a copy
    should be made before use.  For example:

        cat text
	cp text text_copy
	./exer03.sh '1,10d' text_copy
	cat text_copy
	rm text_copy

	# error handling
	./exer03.sh '1,10d' asdf


exer04: execute exer04_if.sh and exer04_case.sh with a single argument and print
    the return status.  For example:

        # yes examples

        ./exer04_if.sh y;        echo $?
	./exer04_if.sh yes;      echo $?
	./exer04_case.sh Yes;    echo $?
	./exer04_case.sh YES;    echo $?
	./exer04_case.sh Y;      echo $?

	# no examples

	./exer04_if.sh no;            echo $?
	./exer04_if.sh asdf;          echo $?
	./exer04_case.sh "yes no";    echo $?
	./exer04_if.sh "";            echo $?
	./exer04_case.sh "";          echo $?

	# syntax error

	./exer04_if.sh
	./exer04_case.sh yes arg2 arg3


exer05: execute exer05.sh with the name of a logged-in user and visually compare
    to the login time from the output of who.  
	
    Note that using the current time isn't sufficient to test all of the edge
    cases.  It's probably advisable to find a way to artificially manipulate the
    program to test a range of login times.  For example, one should test for
    (i) the case where the current minutes time is greater than the login
    minutes time (i.e. login 8:19 and current 9:05), and (ii) the case where the
    current hours time is greater than the login hours time (i.e. login at 10:45
    yesterday and current 8:15 today).
