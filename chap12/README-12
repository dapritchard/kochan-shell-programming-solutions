exer01: execute exer01.sh with a variable number of arguments and then visually
    inspect the output to test.  For example:

        ./exer01.sh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
	./exer01.sh "  a  " "  abc    xyd  " "99"  
	./exer01.sh


exer02: execute exer02.sh with the names of one or more files and then visually
    inspect the output to test.  A small subdirectory hierarchy is included in
    this directory for this purpose.  For example:

        mkdir scratchdir
	mkdir scratchdir2

        ls -R testdir          # show directory hierarchy
	cat testdir/x1         # for example
        cat testdir/adir/a2    # for example
                               # the remaining files look similar

        # Archive a single file in the current directory
        ./exer02.sh exer02.sh > scratchdir/exer02.shar
        ( cd scratchdir; sh exer02.shar )
	diff exer02.sh scratchdir/exer02.sh

        # Archive a single file in a subdirectory
        ./exer02.sh testdir/x1 > scratchdir/x1.shar
        ( cd scratchdir; sh x1.shar )
	diff testdir/x1 scratchdir/testdir/x1

        # Archive multiple files in nested subdirectories.  Note that 
        # testdir/bdir is itself a directory
	./exer02.sh testdir/adir/a1 testdir/adir/wdir/w2 testdir/bdir \
                    > scratchdir/multifile.shar
        ( cd scratchdir; sh multifile.shar )
	ls -R scratchdir/testdir

        # Archive a directory
        ./exer02.sh testdir > scratchdir2/testdir.shar
        ( cd scratchdir2; sh testdir.shar )
        ls -R scratchdir2/testdir

        # Clean up
	rm -r scratchdir scratchdir2


exer03: test exer03.sh by using any of the test scripts from exercise 2 (of course
    substituting exer03.sh in place of exer02.sh)




additional files: a directory testdir with some subdirectories and files for use
    with testing exercise 2 and exercise 3.
