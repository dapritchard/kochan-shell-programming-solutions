Suppose that your HOME directory is /users/steve and that you have
subdirectories as shown in the following figure:

    -- not shown --

Assuming that you just logged in to the system and executed the following
commands:

    $ docs=/users/steve/documents
    $ let=$docs/letters
    $ prop=$docs/proposals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Write the commands in terms of these variables to

a.  List the contents of the documents directory

    ls $docs


b.  Copy all files from the letters directory to the proposals directory

    cp $let/* prop


c.  Move all files whose names contain a capital letter from the letters
    directory to the current directory

    mv $let/*[A-Z]*


d.  Count the number of files in the memos directory

    ls $docs/memos | wc -l

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




What would be the effect of the following commands?

a.  ls $let/..

    Print the names of the files in the /users/steve/documents directory


b.  cat $prop/sys.A >> $let/no.JSK

    If the file /users/steve/documents/proposals exists then append its contents
    to /users/steve/documents/proposals/no.JSK; if the file doesn't exist then
    it appends nothing to no.JSK (i.e. a noop, except that this will create a
    blank file if one doesn't already exist), and an error message is written to
    stderr.


c. echo $let/*

    Print the names of the files in the /users/steve/documents/letters directory


d. cp $let/no.JSK $progs

   If /users/steve/documents/letters/no.JSK exists then copy is to
   /users/steve/documents/proposals/.  Otherwise it is a noop and an error
   message is written to stderr.


e. cd $prop

    Change directory to /users/steve/documents/proposals
