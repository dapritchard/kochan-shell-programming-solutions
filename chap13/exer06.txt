What happens with rolo if the user adds an entry containing a ^ or [ character?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A caret character is translated to a newline.  A [ character (or any other
character with special meaning to grep) causes problems in the rem program
because this is a special character in a grep search, which is an operation that
the program performs in order to remove the desired rolodex entry.
