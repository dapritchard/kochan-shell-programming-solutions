Add a -m command-line option to rolo to send mail to the person who follows on
the command line. Have rolo look up the person in the phone book and then look
for the string mail:mailaddr in the matching entry, where mailaddr is the
person's mail address. Then start up an editor (as in change mode) to allow the
user to enter the mail message. When the editing is complete, mail the message
to the user. If no mail address is found in the phone book, prompt for it.

Also add a mail option to the menu so that it can be selected
interactively. Prompt for the name of the person to send mail to.

The file mailto contains the workhorse program for this functionality.  There
were some small changes that were added to the rolo file in order to handle the
command-line options and the extra within-program rolo option.  See

    diff rolo_orig/rolo rolo

for these changes.  Note that the changes for exercises 3 and 7 are also
reflected in both mailto and rolo.
