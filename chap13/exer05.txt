Modify rolo to use the following convention instead of the exported PHONEBOOK
variable: the file .rolo in each rolo user's home directory contains the
pathname to that user's phone book file, for example:

    $ cat $HOME/.rolo
    /users/steve/misc/phonebook

Then add an option to rolo to allow you to look up someone in another user's
phone book (provided that you have read access to it). This option should be
added to the command line (as a -u option) as well as to the menu. For example,

    $ rolo -u pat Pizza

would look up Pizza in pat's phone book, no matter who is running rolo. The
program can find pat's phone book by looking at .rolo in pat's home directory.

For this exercise, the file rolo_exer05 forks from the file rolo: note that both
rolo and rolo_exer05 include the additional functionality provided by exercise
7.  So the difference in the two comes solely from the convention used in
specifying the location of the phone book file.  See

    diff rolo rolo_exer05

for the differences in the files between the two ways of specifying the location
of the phone book file.
