After adding the -m option, add a -f option to specify that the mail message is
to be taken from the file that follows on the command line. So

    rolo -m tony -f memo

should look up tony and mail him the contents of the file memo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The file mailto contains the workhorse program for this functionality.  There
were some small changes that were added to the rolo file in order to handle the
command-line options and the extra within-program rolo option.  See

    diff rolo_orig/rolo rolo

for these changes.  Note that the changes for exercises 2 and 7 are also
reflected in both mailto and rolo.
