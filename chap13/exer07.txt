Add a –s (send) option to rolo to mail a rolodex entry to a specified user. So

    $ rolo –s tom pizza

should send the rolodex card entry for pizza to the user tom.

IMPORTANT: note that I took the liberty of following a slightly different
command-line interface for this assignment than the one given in the prompt.
The interface that I provided was that when using the -m name option then the
user may also provide a -s card option to provide a pattern with which to
specify a rolodex card to use as the email body, which is a different then the
format specified in the prompt.  To me this made more sense because we already
have an option (the -m option) that specifies a user to send a message to.

The file mailto contains the workhorse program for this functionality.  There
were some small changes that were added to the rolo file in order to handle the
command-line options and the extra within-program rolo option.  See

    diff rolo_orig/rolo rolo

for these changes.  Note that the changes for exercises 2 and 3 are also
reflected in both mailto and rolo.
