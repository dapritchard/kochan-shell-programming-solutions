exer01: execute exer01.sh with the names of 1 or more files to remove.
    exer01.sh has a safety feature that will not permit deletions when the list
    of files to delete is larger than the value of the variable $MAXFILES.  

        MAXFILES=5 ; export MAXFILES

        # Successful removal
        touch aa ab ac
        ./exer01.sh a*

        # Too many removals relative to $MAXFILES
        touch aa ab ac ad ae af ag
        ./exer01.sh a*

        # Empty file list
        ./exer01.sh

        # Some files don't exist	
        ./exer01.sh aa za zb <<< yes
        ls a*

        # All files don't exist
        ./exer01.sh za zb

	# $MAXFILES set to 0 is a special case as per the directions
	MAXFILES=0 ; export MAXFILES
	./exer01.sh ab ac

	# Bad values for MAXFILES
	MAXFILES=asdf    ; export MAXFILES ; ./exer01.sh ad ae
	MAXFILES=-1      ; export MAXFILES ; ./exer01.sh ad ae
	MAXFILES=1.25    ; export MAXFILES ; ./exer01.sh ad ae
	MAXFILES="1 2 3" ; export MAXFILES ; ./exer01.sh ad ae

	# Return to original state
        rm a?
        MAXFILES=
	export MAXFILES


exer02: see exer02.sh for an answer to this question, and test02.sh (and prog1
    and prog2) to test the answer


exer03: execute exer03.sh with or without the exported environmental variable
    $PHONEBOOK specifying the location of the phone book file.  For example:

        # Using default location of phonebook, add, look up, and 
	# (unsuccessfully) remove
	unset PHONEBOOK
	printf 'y\n2\njohn\n256-3948\n1\njohn\n3\nsteve\n0\n' | ./exer03.sh
	cat phonebook

	# Using add, lu, and rem as stand-alone programs with default location
	# of phonebook
	./lu john
	./add mark 772-1020
	./rem john
	cat phonebook

	# Remove phone book file after testing
	rm phonebook

	# Using user-specified location of phonebook, add, look up, and
	# (unsuccessfully) remove
	PHONEBOOK=test_phb ; export PHONEBOOK
	printf 'y\n2\njohn\n256-3948\n1\njohn\n3\nsteve\n0\n' | ./exer03.sh
	cat test_phb

	# Using add, lu, and rem as stand-alone programs with user-specified
	# location of phonebook
	./lu john
	./add mark 772-1020
	./rem john
	cat test_phb

	# Remove phone book file after testing
	rm test_phb
