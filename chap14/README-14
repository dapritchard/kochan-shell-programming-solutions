exer01: execute exer01.sh with the names of files provided as arguments.  Note
    that this version of the program does not print dot files; since this is the
    default behavior of ls this seems like a reasonable first version.  To test,
    execute for example:

        ./exer01.sh
        ./exer01.sh exer01.sh README-14

        ls -R testdir
        ./exer01.sh testdir
	./exer01.sh testdir/x1 testdir/bdir testdir/adir


exer02: execute exer02.sh with octal numbers as arguments to test.  For example:

        ./exer02.sh
        ./exer02.sh 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 20 100 1000

        # Doesn't work
	./exer02.sh 18
        ./exer02.sh ""
        ./exer02.sh "1 2"
        ./exer02.sh 1a


exer03: execute exer03.sh in the current environment to load the cdh function
    into memory and then navigate around the directory tree; also use the -l
    option to see the history of visited directories and the -n option to move
    to the n-th visited directory.  For example:

        . ./exer03.sh
        cdh -l

	cdh testdir
        cdh 'dir with spaces'
        cdh 'dirstar*'
        cdh -l

        cdh ..
        cdh ..
        cdh ..
        cdh -l

        cdh -2
        cdh -1
        cdh -0

        # bad input
	cdh asdf
	cdh -22

        # clean up
        unset CDHIST cdh


exer04: see exer04.txt for an answer to this question


exer05: execute exer05.sh in the current environment to load the cdh function
    into memory and then navigate around the directory tree; then use the
    -pattern option to jump between directories.  For example:

        . ./exer05.sh
	cdh 'testdir'
        cdh 'dir with spaces'
        cdh 'dirstar*'
	cdh -l

        # Note that we have to anchor some directories with a $ to get a unique
        # match
        cdh -spaces\$
        cdh -14\$
        cdh -star
        cdh -l

	# Number argument and - shortcut should still work
	cdh -0
	cdh -3
	cdh -

	# Too few or many too pattern matches
	cdh -asdf
	cdh -spaces

        # Clean up
        unset CDHIST cdh


exer06: execute exer06.sh in the current environment to load the cdh function
    into memory and then navigate around the directory tree; then use the old
    new option to change directories.  For example:

        . ./exer06.sh
	cdh 'testdir'
        cdh adir
        cdh ad bd
	cdh 14 12
	cdh -0

        # Clean up
        unset CDHIST cdh




additional files: a directory testdir with some subdirectories and files for use
    with testing exercises 3, 5, and 6.
