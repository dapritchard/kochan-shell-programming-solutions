What will be matched by the following regular expressions?


x*

    0 or more consecutive x's


[0-9]\{3\}

    A sequence of exactly 3 consecutive digits


xx* 

    1 or more consecutive x's


[0-9]\{3,5\}

    A sequence of between 3 and 5 consecutive digits


x\{1,5\}

    A sequence of between 1 and 5 consecutive x's


[0-9]\{1,3\},[0-9]\{3\}

    A sequence of between 1 and 3 consecutive digits, followed by a comma,
    followed by exactly 3 consecutive digits


x\{5,\}

    A sequence of 5 or more x's


^\...

    The first character in the string is a period, followed by any 2 more
    characters


x\{10\}

    A sequence of exactly 10 x's 


[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*

    Any alphabetic letter or underscore, followed by any number of alphabetic
    letters or underscores or digits.  This matches a legal variable name in
    some programming languages.


[0-9] 

    Any digit


\([A-Za-z0-9]\{1,\}\)\1

    A run of even-valued length of the same alphabetic letter or digit.
    I.e. xxx would match xx.  Initially a run of length 1 or longer is matched
    and stored in register 1, and then the value of that register is placed in
    the regex.


[0-9]*

    0 or more occurances of a digit


^Begin$

    The string is exactly Begin


[0-9][0-9][0-9]

    Exactly 3 digits


^\(.\).*\1$

    The first character of the string is the same as the last
