What will be the effect of the following commands?


who | grep 'mary'

    Print any lines from the output of who with the word mary in them.  Might be
    used to see if any when the user Mary logged in.


who | grep '^mary'

    Print any lines from the output of who starting with the string mary.


grep '[Uu]nix' ch?/*

    If no directory with a name of length 3 characters and starting with ch
    exists, then terminate with an error message.  If any such directories
    exist, then search each file in each such directory for either the word unix
    or Unix and print any lines that contain that word.

ls -l | sort +4n

    This did not work as printed on my system, and I don't see anything about
    using a + in either the man pages or the book.  Replacing +4n with -k5 -n
    sorts the long output of ls by file size.


sed '/^$/d' text > text.out

    If no file with name text exists then terminate with an error message.  If
    text exists, then delete every blank line in text and write to text.out.


sed 's/\([Uu]nix\)/\1(TM)/g' text > text.out

    If no file with name text exists then terminate with an error message.  If
    text exists, then insert a (TM) after every instance of Unix or unix in text
    and write to text.out.


date | cut -c12-16

     Print characters 12-16 from the output of date.  On my system this gives
     the time.


date | cut -c5-11,25- | sed 's/\([0-9]\{1,2\}\)/\1,/'

    Take characters 5-11 and 25- end of the line, and then add a comma to the
    largest first instance of either 1 or 2 consecutive digits of the line.  On
    my system this prints a date, such as Oct 17, 2016.
