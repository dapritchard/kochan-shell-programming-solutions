Write the commands to count the number of characters stored in the shell
variable text.  Then write the commands to count all the alphabetic characters
(hint: use sed and wc).  What happens to special character sequences such as \n
if they're stored inside text?

text='A rose by any other name !@#$\n'


# Note that echo adds a newline at the end of text so we get one extra character
# than we might expect; this can be verified using od as below.  An alternative
# to echo would be to use printf, but we have not covered this function yet.

# Counts the number of characters $text, plus one for the added newline
echo "$text" | wc -m

# Remove everything not an alphabetic character with sed, and then count how
# many are remaining, plus one for the added newline.  [:alpha:] is a character
# class and in the C local and with ASCII character encoding, this is equivalent
# to [A-Za-z]
echo "$text" | sed 's/[^[:alpha:]]*//g' | wc -m

# Verify that a newline is added
echo 'asdf' | od -c
