What happens to the rolo program if just an Enter is given as the name for the
add, look up, or remove options?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


add: the original version of add allowed a blank entry to be provided as a valid
    name or number.  This does not seem like particularly desirable behavior,
    and so the program was modified so that a blank entry is no longer
    considered valid.

look up: a look up, which is powered by grep, by definition matches everything
    on a blank.  This seems like a useful feature to allow the user to very
    conveniently print the entire phone book, and so is left as is.

remove: a remove operation, which is powered by grep, by definition matches
    everything on a blank.  This seems like a useful feature to allow the user
    step through all of the names in the phone book and delete some or all of
    the entries (recall that the user is prompted for individual confirmation to
    delete entries when there are multiple matches), and so is left as is.
