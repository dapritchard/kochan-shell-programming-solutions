exer01: when one or more files doesn't exist then a copy is performed with the
    remaining files that do exist, assuming that there are any.  One concern is
    that if some number out of a list of files do not exist, then the user may
    not wish to copy the remaining.  The program has been edited to check if any
    files do not exist and ask the user if they still want to perform the copy.

    Execute exer03.sh with SOURCE DEST or SOURCE... DIRECTORY arguments.  For
    example:

        mkdir testdir

	# Neither file exists
	./exer01.sh a b testdir

	# Now try with one file
	touch a
	./exer01.sh a b testdir

	rm a
	rm -r testdir

exer03: execute exer03.sh with similar tests as for exercise 1


exer04: execute exer04.sh without any arguments and perform a copy


exer05: execute exer05.sh with the -n option to overwrite a file without a
    prompt.  For example:

        echo 1234 > a
        touch b
	ls -l a b            # Different file sizes

	./exer05.sh -n a b
	ls -l a b            # Now the same file size


exer06: execute exer06.sh with similar tests as for exercises 1-5


exer07: execute test07.sh to add, look up, and remove entries to the phonebook
    via exer07.sh


exer08: execute exer08.sh and try a few add, look up, and remove operations.
    For example:

        ./exer08.sh
	2               # add a name
	chris
	212-4957
	2               # add a name
	christy
	182-2484
	1               # look up names
	chris
	0               # exit

	rm phonebook
