What happens to mycp if one of the filenames contains a character that has a
special meaning to the shell such as ; or |?

Surprisingly enough, the program still seems to work!?!

^^ With the exception of blanks, that is.  Even after escaping them with a \
they are still split in the for loop.  The solution to this of course is to
store the variables in an array, but we haven't learned how to do this yet.

So why does the program work?  I can't really say, but perhaps the filname
substitution is performed after the expression is parsed for special characters?
